<h1>Dr. Horrible Freezeray</h1>

Took: 4 man-weeks over the course of 12 weeks. <br/>
This took really long to finish, because this was my first project of this kind and magnitude. A lot of planning and a lot of trial and error was required. And there is always the question where to source the materials.<br/>

<p>
First we need a 'box'. Because I thought, that the freezeray would be too light, I chose pretty heavy and tough wood.<br/>
The initial main gun was an aluminum pipe we had lying around. I sanded it, but wasn't so happy with it. It had a few flaws. So I bought a new leg of a table for the main barrel.<br/>
<br/>
Back handle (or shoulder pad)
It turned out to be really helpful to use wood hidden behind metal to connect things.<br/>
Thick double sided tape fills the gap.<br/>
I wanted to keep the lower handle as simple as possible, while being really sturdy. This is a small table leg. Perfect.<br/>
I knew, I couldn't replicate the original professional 'top lid'. So I got creative. These are thermoformed plastic parts from a hard drive transport box and half a small bottle. With more time one could fill in the holes with putty or something.<br/>
