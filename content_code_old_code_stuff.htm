-Printing the view in black and white
-Connects to Word to print bills


I am still proud of this first big project. It has its quirks, because of some things I didn't know back then. But I put a lot of effort in it, to make it really responsive. Resizing takes some time to redraw, but only once, and not every iteration. Pulling a lasso is really efficient, because the image is buffered.

<h3>Mikrotiter Plate Workflow</h3>
<p>

<h3>Peptoid Mass Search</h3>
<p>



language: Excel VBA

date: 12/2012

time frame: 1-2 weeks

features:

The list to the left contains the given amines (chemical stuff) and their masses. The matrix contains combinations of given amines, by taking one of each column. Given the peaks of a mass histogram, one can identify the material (e.g. BAAAAA-Linker) by entering them into the search field. The search then calculates the submasses of every material combination and finds the best fit.

<h3>Net Shark</h3>
<p>
2009

Implementation of the board game shark in C# and with network ability. Developed to practice C# for the XNA game development lab. I created all the graphics by myself. The rules tend to get pretty complicated for corner cases. tbh I never fully debugged the network code.

The small white numbers near the skyscrapers (those who know will recognize that) are for debugging. I needed to know, how big each side by side connected block of houses is, but didn't want to search the whole field. So I used this method:

A new house without neighbors gets a new ID whose block size is 1.
A new house with a neighbor in the same color gets the neighbor ID and increases this ID's block size by one.
I thought that was pretty elegant.
