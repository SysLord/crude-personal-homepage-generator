<h1>UFO Alarmclock Mod</h1>

<p>
	One day I needed to modify this UFO alarm clock.<br/>
	Nothing special:<br/>
	AVR attiny2303<br/>
	USB-RD232 adapter<br/>
	cheap display with artifacts<br/>
	a lot of hot glue
</p>

<p>
	First look inside: The clock is completely indepedent from the alarm and UFO firing part. Perfect! The alarm board is even correctly labelled.<br/>
	One thing we need to keep in mind is that the AVR will be powered from USB and the alarm by battery. The reason is that the alarm needs 4*1.5V and I don't want to risk connecting it to USB or the AVR.
	Not sure if it is possible to power the alarm-active pin from a different power source. But a large enough resistor might prevent problems.<br/>
	Make sure everything fits and done.<br/>
	Seems I even added connectors for programming.

	Zeile1: m0&lt;message&gt;<br/>
